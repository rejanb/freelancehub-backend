## 3. User: (Django traceback about ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'users.urls')

**Assistant:**
The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'users.urls'` means Django cannot find the `users` app or its `urls.py` file. Make sure:
- The `users` app exists in your project directory.
- There is a `urls.py` file inside the `users` app.
- The `users` app is included in `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`.
- You are running the command from the correct project root.

---

## 4. User: (Django traceback about ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'users')

**Assistant:**
The error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'users'` means Django cannot find the `users` app. Make sure:
- The `users` app exists in your project directory.
- The app is included in `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `settings.py`.
- You are running the command from the correct project root.

---

## 5. User: SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues: ...

**Assistant:**
This error is due to a conflict between your custom user model and Django's default `auth.User` model. You need to set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.CustomUser'` in your `settings.py` and ensure you only use your custom user model throughout your project.

---

## 6. User: yes

**Assistant:**
Thank you for confirming. Please let me know your next question or issue.

---

## 7. User: Page not found (404) ...

**Assistant:**
The 404 error means the URL you are trying to access does not match any defined route. Check your `urls.py` to ensure the path exists and you are using the correct URL in your browser or API client.

---

## 8. User: Can you check my chats module it is not working

**Assistant:**
Your chats module contains the standard Django app files. Please specify what is not working (e.g., errors, unexpected behavior) so I can help you debug it.

---

## 9. User: Web socket is not working for me

**Assistant:**
Your ASGI and routing setup looks mostly correct. Make sure:
- You are connecting to the correct websocket URL.
- Redis is running.
- You are running the server with Daphne or Uvicorn, not the default runserver.
- Your consumer is implemented correctly.
If you have a specific error, please share it.

---

## 10. User: (Daphne not installed error)

**Assistant:**
You do not have the Daphne server installed. Install it with `pip install daphne` and run your server with Daphne for websocket support.

---

## 11. User: do i neeed to add daphe in requirement .txt

**Assistant:**
Yes, you should add `daphne` to your `requirements.txt` to ensure it is installed in all environments.

---

## 12. User: yes

**Assistant:**
I have added `daphne` to your `requirements.txt` file.

---

## 13. User: (404 for static/admin/img/icon-viewlink.svg and KeyError: 'room_name' in ChatConsumer)

**Assistant:**
Update your websocket route to include a `room_name` parameter in `chats/routing.py`:
```python
re_path(r"ws/chat/(?P<room_name>[^/]+)/$", consumers.ChatConsumer.as_asgi()),
```
This will fix the KeyError.

---

## 14. User: how do i test it

**Assistant:**
You can test your websocket chat by opening a browser console or using a websocket client to connect to `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/chat/room1/` and sending/receiving messages.

---

## 15. User: Can you give me a html file

**Assistant:**
I have created a simple `chat.html` file for you to test your websocket chat. Open it in your browser, connect to a room, and send messages.

---

## 16. User: Is this method secure

**Assistant:**
The method is not secure by default. You should check if the user is authenticated in your consumer and restrict access as needed.

---

## 17. User: How do i do that  and how do i know the room when user chats

**Assistant:**
Add an authentication check in your consumer's `connect` method. Include the room name in your messages so the frontend knows which room the message is for.

---

## 18. User: Now i want to do the review module reviews (ratings, linked to users and jobs/contracts)

**Assistant:**
Create a `reviews` app, add a `Review` model with rating, comment, reviewer, reviewee, and a generic relation to jobs/contracts. Set up serializers, views, and URLs for API access.

The disputes API route was missing. I have added it to your main URL configuration. You can now access `/api/disputes/`.
